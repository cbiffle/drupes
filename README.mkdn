# `drupes`: removes dupes

This is a (relatively) simple command line tool for finding, and optionally
removing, duplicate files.

To install, you will need a Rust toolchain. Check out this repo and run (from
the repo directory):

```
cargo install --path .
```

Simple example (running the program against the Small Device C Compiler source
code):

```
# get a summary:
$ drupes ~/src/sdcc280 -m
1859 duplicate files (in 995 sets), occupying 30.2 MiB
checked 16150 files in 4220 size classes

# list the groups of duplicate files:
$ drupes ~/src/sdcc280
/home/cbiffle/src/sdcc280/sdcc/device/lib/huge/crtstart.rel
/home/cbiffle/src/sdcc280/sdcc/device/lib/large/crtstart.rel
/home/cbiffle/src/sdcc280/sdcc/device/lib/large-stack-auto/crtstart.rel
/home/cbiffle/src/sdcc280/sdcc/device/lib/mcs51/crtstart.rel
/home/cbiffle/src/sdcc280/sdcc/device/lib/medium/crtstart.rel
/home/cbiffle/src/sdcc280/sdcc/device/lib/small/crtstart.rel
/home/cbiffle/src/sdcc280/sdcc/device/lib/small-stack-auto/crtstart.rel

/home/cbiffle/src/sdcc280/sdcc/device/lib/pdk13/atoi.sym
/home/cbiffle/src/sdcc280/sdcc/device/lib/pdk14/atoi.sym
# ...and so on
```

## Command line usage

```
Finds duplicate files and optionally deletes them

Usage: drupes [OPTIONS] [ROOTS]...

Arguments:
  [ROOTS]...  List of directories to search, recursively, for duplicate files; if
              omitted, the current directory is searched

Options:
  -e, --empty       Also consider empty files, which will report all empty files
                    except one as duplicate (which is rarely what you want)
  -f, --omit-first  Don't print the first filename in a set of duplicates, so that
                    all the printed filenames are files to consider removing
  -m, --summarize   Instead of listing duplicates, print a summary of what was
                    found
  -p, --paranoid    Engages "paranoid mode" and performs byte-for-byte comparisons
                    of files, in case you've found the first real-world BLAKE3
                    hash collision (please publish it if so)
      --delete      Try to delete all duplicates but one, skipping any files that
                    cannot be deleted for whatever reason
  -h, --help        Print help
```

## What's a duplicate file?

A file is a duplicate if some other file has exactly the same contents, but
possibly a different name. For example, if you make a copy of a file with no
other changes, that will count as a duplicate.

`drupes` only notices duplicates within the directory or directories you
specify, so a duplicate file somewhere else on your computer (or on that microSD
card you lost in the couch) won't get reported.

More specifically, `drupes` considers two files to be duplicates if, and only
if,

1. They have exactly the same length, in bytes.
2. Their contents hash to the same value using BLAKE3.
3. If the `--paranoid` flag is given, their contents also match byte-for-byte.

Because BLAKE3 is currently a well-respected cryptographic hash algorithm that's
considered fairly collision-resistant, two files with the same size and BLAKE3
hash are _very likely_ to have the same exact contents. The `--paranoid` mode
should not generally be necessary, and is somewhat slower.

**Unix users:** Currently, `drupes` considers two files to be duplicates even if
they are hardlinked to the same inode. This is deliberate; I developed the tool
to winnow down a photo library, not to conserve disk space. If this bugs you,
I'd be open to adding a switch to control it!


## Performance

I haven't put a lot of work into optimizing performance, but by slapping
together several off-the-shelf crates, `drupes` winds up being pretty fast.

In a very conservative test, where I drop the entire system's filesystem cache
before measuring (to ensure that reads are coming from disk and not memory),
`drupes` is 1.7 - 7.4x faster than the other tools I use:

| Tool | 14G of git repos | 15G of photos |
| ---- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| fdupes | 19.322 s | 3.144 s |
| rmlint | 9.513 s | 1.341 s |
| **drupes** | 2.594s | 0.788 s |

In practice, I don't drop the system page cache while I'm working, so a "cache
warm" test is more representative of my day-to-day experience using `drupes`. In
this case the gap widens to 3-11x (larger files make the gap larger):

| Tool | 14G of git repos | 15G of photos |
| ---- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| fdupes | 3.134 s | 2.131 s |
| rmlint | 2.206 s | 0.865 s |
| **drupes** | 0.720 s | 0.198 s |
